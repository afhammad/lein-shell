# lein-shell

A Leiningen plugin for calling shell commands.

## Usage

Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-shell "0.2.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
lein-shell 0.2.0`.

Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-shell "0.2.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

It is very straightforward to use lein-shell: lein-shell will call the shell
command with eventual parameters you include. For instance, if you want your
favourite cow to say hello to you from Leiningen, the following will be printed
within your shell:

    $ lein shell cowsay 'Hello from Leiningen!'
	 _______________________
    < Hello from Leiningen! >
     -----------------------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||

Now, this may look rather useless as you can just omit `lein shell` and get the
exact same result in less time. However, it may be of value if you're using
`make` or `ANTLR` to generate files for you, needed by your Clojure project. For
example, to automatically call `make` before running tasks, add this to your
`project.clj` map:

```clj
:prep-tasks [["shell" "make"] "javac" "compile"]
```

If the command exits with a nonzero exit code, shell will (attempt to) exit
Leiningen with the same exit code. If wanted to, this functionality can be
overridden, and many other settings can be modified as well. For more
information, have a look at [the documentation][documentation]. It contains a
lot of examples, some which may be useful to you.
